# DevSecOps Pipeline

End-to-end DevSecOps platform, from commit to production: secure CI/CD pipeline, hardened Kubernetes deployment, infrastructure defined in Terraform, secrets in HashiCorp Vault, and monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana.

All of it is applied to a Flask API running in production at [rpg-pipeline.onrender.com](https://rpg-pipeline.onrender.com), which serves the monsters of a C++ RPG game. The goal wasn't the application itself, but to reproduce the practices of an enterprise DevOps team.

**At a glance**
- 12 CI jobs on every push and pull request, 10 of them required to merge; the image is published and signed only if all checks pass
- The Docker image is built once, scanned (Trivy), attacked (OWASP ZAP), then that exact image is signed (Cosign)
- Only images signed by the pipeline can run in the cluster, enforced by Kyverno
- 58 unit tests (98% coverage), including attack tests, and 16 tests for the Kyverno policies
- 189 Trivy alerts triaged, HTTP (ZAP) and Kubernetes (Checkov) misconfigurations fixed
- 17 Terraform resources to rebuild the entire environment
- Secrets encrypted in Vault, never stored in plaintext in the cluster

## CI/CD Pipeline

```
push / pull request -> main
 |
 |-- step 1, in parallel:
 |    |-- analyse-code: Gitleaks + Cppcheck (C++ code)
 |    |-- scan-jeu: Docker build (game) + Trivy
 |    |-- sast-api: Bandit + Semgrep
 |    |-- tests-api: pytest, minimum 95% coverage
 |    |-- iac-scan-checkov: Kubernetes manifests, Helm chart and Terraform
 |    |-- kyverno-policy-test: policy unit tests + policies replayed against the manifests
 |    |-- terraform-check: Terraform code formatting and validation
 |    `-- build-api: Docker build of the API, done once
 |
 |-- step 2, on the image built in step 1:
 |    |-- scan-api: Trivy
 |    `-- dast-api-local: smoke test + OWASP ZAP against the running container
 |
 `-- step 3, on main only, if everything passed:
      `-- supply-chain-api: publishing, SBOM (Syft), signing (Cosign)

On main, dast-api also scans the live API (Render) with OWASP ZAP, as monitoring.
```

Scans run before the merge, not after. Pre-commit hooks rerun most of these checks locally before the push even happens, results show up in the **Security > Code scanning** tab, and Dependabot keeps dependencies up to date by going through the same checks.

## Deployment

All three methods need a `.env` file at the root of the repo with `API_SECRET_KEY`, `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Commands are for PowerShell (Windows).

### Docker

The quickest way to run the API locally.

<details>
<summary>Commands</summary>

```
docker build -t rpg-api -f rpg-api/Dockerfile .
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --env-file .env -v rpg-data:/app/data rpg-api
```

</details>

The API is available at **http://localhost:5000**

### Helm

First version of the Kubernetes deployment (Kind), before Vault: non-root container, read-only filesystem, resource limits, health probes and NetworkPolicy. Secrets still go through a Kubernetes `Secret`.

<details>
<summary>Commands</summary>

```
kind create cluster --config k8s/kind-config.yaml
docker build -t rpg-api:local -f rpg-api/Dockerfile .
kind load docker-image rpg-api:local --name rpg-pipeline
helm install rpg-api helm/rpg-api --namespace rpg-pipeline --create-namespace
kubectl create secret generic rpg-api-secret --namespace rpg-pipeline --from-env-file=.env --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f -
kubectl rollout restart deployment/rpg-api -n rpg-pipeline
kubectl port-forward -n rpg-pipeline svc/rpg-api 5000:80
```

</details>

The API is available at **http://localhost:5000**

### Terraform and Vault

Full version: Terraform rebuilds the cluster, Kyverno, Vault, the application and the monitoring stack. The cluster runs the image signed by the pipeline, pulled from GitHub Container Registry; Kyverno verifies its signature and pins its digest. Secrets are encrypted in Vault and injected at pod startup by a sidecar; each pod authenticates with its own ServiceAccount, with read-only, time-limited access.

<details>
<summary>Commands</summary>

```
cd terraform
terraform init
terraform apply "-target=kind_cluster.rpg"
terraform apply
cd ..

.\vault\init-vault.ps1

kubectl port-forward -n rpg-pipeline svc/rpg-api 5000:80
```

`init-vault.ps1` initializes and configures Vault, loads the secrets from `.env`, then revokes the root token. The unseal keys are encrypted with Windows DPAPI and stored in `.vault-keys/`, ignored by Git.

After a Docker or PC restart, Vault starts sealed:

```
.\vault\unseal-vault.ps1
```

</details>

The API is available at **http://localhost:5000**

## Monitoring

Prometheus collects cluster state and API metrics, and Grafana displays them in dashboards. An alert fires when there are more than 10 rejected logins within 5 minutes.

<details>
<summary>Commands</summary>

```
$pw = kubectl get secret monitoring-grafana -n monitoring -o jsonpath="{.data.admin-password}"
[Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String($pw))
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/monitoring-grafana 3000:80
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/monitoring-kube-prometheus-prometheus 9090:9090
```

</details>

Grafana is available at **http://localhost:3000** (user `admin`), Prometheus at **http://localhost:9090**. Each `port-forward` takes up its own terminal.

## Game Sync

```
py play.py
```

The script fetches the monsters from the live API and updates `monsters.csv` before launching the game.

## Tools Used
